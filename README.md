# Setup-for-React-environment
### Initial setup for creating a new React environment
***
It uses the `create-react-app` which is an officially supported way to create React applications.

Here are the steps that you need to do:
1. Create a React application by first installing the `create-react-app`, this install as global.
    - `npm install -g create-react-app`
2. Create a new folder under the folder where you run the first step.
    - `npx create-react-app myfirstreact`

The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

***
If you followed the two commands above, you are ready to run your first real React application :)

Run this command to execute the React application myfirstreact:
    - C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact> `npm start`
